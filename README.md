## Introducation

### What is Portfolio of EFL AV
Welcome to my website portfolio! As a junior web developer, I am excited to showcase my skills and creativity through the websites I have designed and developed. 
Each project reflects my passion for clean and functional design, as well as my dedication to writing high-quality code that is both efficient and maintainable. 
Whether you're looking for a simple brochure site or a complex web application, I have the experience and expertise to deliver a website that meets your needs and 
exceeds your expectations. Take a look at my portfolio and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project!
